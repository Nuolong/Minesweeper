Teacher: Ms.Qiu
Period: 7

This minesweeper game is to run as a typical one. A grid with squares will be displayed and the user will be able to decide
what square they would like to select. There will be a certain number of squares in the grid that contain a mine. If the 
player selects a square that contains a mine, then they lose. If they select a square that does not have a mine, the square
changes to display the number of mines surrounding it, in the 8 squares adjacent to the single square chosen. The player 
will be able to select a square, set a flag on a square as a sign of suspecting a mine, or a question mark for something
unsure.
